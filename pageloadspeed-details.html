<title>Page load speed tool: documentation</title>

<p>Randomly ordered details to mind when benchmarking a page load time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The averaged timing is valid <b>if and only if</b> it is labelled <b>valid</b>.
<li>If comparing two or more blockers:
    <ul>
    <li>Be sure the benchmarked blocker is the only active extension.
    <li>To benchmark another blocker, disable the current one, enable the other blocker, then ...
        <ul>
        <li>Chromium: open the page load speed tool <a href="pageloadspeed.html" target="_blank">in a new tab</a>.
        <li>Firefox: restart the browser.
        </ul>
    <li>Configure them in a similar way.
    </ul>
<li>Clicking the <i>Benchmark</i> button will launch an automated benchmark session which will end when the average page load time is marked as "valid".
<li>If you want to bypass the browser cache, open de developer console and check the <i>"disable cache when dev console is opened"</i> setting of your browser.
    <ul>
    <li>Bypassing the cache can lead to more erratic results though, as the measurements become more sensitive to arbitrary network latency. 
    </ul>
<li>There is a timeout for when a page never completes loading: 30 seconds.
    <ul>
    <li>The result will be discarded in such case.
    </ul>
<li>This page load speed tool works only for web pages which accept to be embedded in a frame.
<li>Since the web page to measure is inside a frame, it may not rendered correctly if you block 3rd-party cookies (a good idea in general).
<li>This tool can also be used to compare different configurations for the same blocker. For examples:
    <ul>uBlock Origin <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode">easy mode vs. medium mode</a>.
    <li>Adblock Plus with "acceptable ads" enabled versus "acceptable ads" disabled.
    </ul>
<li>When you share the results, you should provide all the information:
    <ul>
    <li>Browser, version, relevant settings (click-to-play, block 3rd-party cookies, etc.)
    <li>Blocker, version, filter lists, settings.
    <li>Which URL was benchmarked.
    <li>Disclose the whole average result of the benchmark, for example: <code>Average (valid): 832.01 ms (10/13 iterations)</code>.
    <li>Etc.
    </ul>
<li>Keep in mind uBlock Origin disables pre-fetching by default -- most other blockers do not modify this browser setting.
    <ul>
    <li>I haven't confirmed so far that this makes a significant difference in page load speed.
    </ul>
<li>The page load speed tool is completely self-contained, just look at the page source to see how it works.
    <ul>
    <li>Being self-contained means you can save a local copy onto your computer and launch from there.
    <li>There is a prototypical feel to the code, I emphasized on it working, not being elegant. I may work more on it as time allows.
    </ul>
</ul>
